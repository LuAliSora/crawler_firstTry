    Get pic from a web

## To Start:
    1. Create "picFile" 
    2. In "picFile", create "tags.txt" and write {tags} in it
    3. Run "main.py" or "main_byClass.py"

## Note:
    1. Run "main.py: mode1 to get pic path, mode2 to download pic
    2. In "baseSet.py", change "User-Agent" if you need
    3. "learn_re.py", "wall.py" are not used

## Problem:
    1. Net problem to access oversea web
    2. File path problem in "import"
    3. "main.py" may have problem when num of tags >1
